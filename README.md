# Global Dev - Singles365

This project is part of an application process for Global Personals.

This brief example should demonstrate my skills  in HTML/CSS markup while introducing some JavaScript functionality.

## Intentions

My main intentions are to firstly, and foremost, make a responsive prototype.

My next priority is to automate the input of data using a JSON string provided, which would then allow for a content structure to be implemented appropriately. This method of data input would also allow me to read through the content and, upon the user's request in the browser, sort the results as they wish, using options provided.

## Successes

I successfully completed a responsive prototype, alternating between several views of how the results are displayed in a grid layout, or a more detailed view.

I automated the input of data in an effort to reduce the amount of hardcoded HTML, and code in general.

## Failures

Had I more time, I would have been able to implement auto-sort functionality into the drop-down menu above the results, where the user would select their preference, and have their re-ordered list displayed.

This method would have involved using the `usort()` function, but to also include a script to re-order the search results without refreshing or reloading the page.
